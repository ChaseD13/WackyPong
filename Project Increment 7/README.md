# Project Increment 7

The functionality from the previous increment and a working menu system for your game. Assume the user only has a mouse and keyboard to navigate the menus. Starting a two player game should bring the player to the gameplay functionality you’ve implemented up to this point. The user should be able to navigate through a complete menu system by running your code. You do NOT have to implement the one player button or the difficulty menu yet. The game should end (with the required message) when one of the players wins. You also need to implement the speedup pickup functionality in your game.”
